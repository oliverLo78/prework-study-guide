# prework-study-guide 
A study guide for course pre-work

-The motivation for the study guide is to have notes that boot camp students can refer to online on the topics covered in the coding bootcamp.

-This project was built to have all the notes in one place about HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript computer programming tools.

-The main problem this project will solve is that I will have my notes in easy to find URL that can go back to review.

-I learned some of the basics of HTML content frame, CSS styles such as shadow box, Git work flow, and JavaScript basics variable 
 and array declaration and for loops

## Usage

the way it works is pretty simple to use the study guide just review the notes in each section. For suggestion on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by
pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) or Control+Shift+I(Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. 
There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along the a suggestion on which topic to study first.
