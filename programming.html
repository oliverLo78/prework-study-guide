            <p>1. Encapsulation - is a concept of hiding data by wrapping up members into a single unit such as a
                Class. It provides security to data members by making the variable private, and then 
                creating public getter/setter methods to access those variables.</p>
            <ul class="card">
                <li>Getters & Setters - The get method returns the variable value, and the set method sets the value.
                Syntax for both is that they start with either get or set, followed by the name of the variable, with the first letter in upper case:</li>
                    <p class="item"> // Set the value of the name variable to "John" <br>
                    System.out.println(myObj.getName()); <br>
                        } 
                    }
                // Outputs "John";</p>
                <li>Access Control -  controls the access level; Non-Access Modifiers - do not control access level, but provides other functionality</li>
               
                <li>Access Modifiers - Properties and methods can have access modifiers which control where they can be accessed.
                    There are three access modifiers:
        
                <li>public - the property or method can be accessed from everywhere. This is default</li>
                <li>protected - the property or method can be accessed within the class and by classes derived from that class</li> 
                <li>private - the property or method can ONLY be accessed within the class</li>
                <li>Class Binding - The binding means the process of converting identifiers into addresses. For each variables and functions this binding is done. For functions it is matching the call with the right function definition by the compiler </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>2. Inheritance - the ability of creating a new class from an existing class. Inheritance is when an object acquires the property of another object. Inheritance allows a class (subclass) to acquire the properties and behavior of another class (super-class). It helps to reuse, customize and enhance the existing code.</p>
            <ul class="card">
                <li>Hierarchical inheritance - </li>
                <li>Parent Class vs. Child Class -Create a class named "Model" which will inherit the methods from the "Car" class, by using the extends keyword. By calling the super() method in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor method and gets access to the parent's properties and method </li>
                <p class="item">abstract class Product { <br>
                    int multiplyBy; <br>
                    public Product( int multiplyBy ) { <br>
                        this.multiplyBy = multiplyBy; <br>
                    }
                    <br>
                    public int mutiply(int val) { <br>
                       return multiplyBy * val; <br>
                    } <br>
                } <br>
                    <br>
                class TimesTwo extends Product { <br>
                    public TimesTwo() { <br>
                        super(2); <br>
                    } <br>
                } <br>
                
                class TimesWhat extends Product {
                    public TimesWhat(int what) {
                        super(what);
                    }
                }</p>
            </ul>

            <p>3. Abstraction – Partially built, or incomplete classes which can serve as a foundation for other classes.</p>
            <ul class="card">
                <li>Interfaces - In Object Oriented Programming Languages. An interface is a programming structure/syntax that allows the computer to enforce certain properties on an object (class). For example, say we have a car class and a scooter class and a truck class. Each of these three classes should have a start_engine() action.</li>
                <li>Abstract classes - is a template definition of methods and variables in a specific class, or category of objects <img src="./assets/images/Abstract-Class-vs-Interface.png" alt="Abstract-Class-vs-Interface">
                <li>Abstract Methods - a method that is declared, but not implemented in the code. Abstract classes and methods are when the parent class has a named method, but need its child class(es) to fill out the tasks </li>
                <li>Constructors - is a special type of function called to create an object. It prepares the new object for use, often accepting arguments</li>
                <li>Default Constructors - If the programmer does not supply a constructor for an instantiable class, Java compiler inserts a default constructor into your code on your behalf.</li> 
                    <p class="item">#include <iostream>

                        class Student {
                         public:
                          Student(int a = 0, int b = 0);  // Default constructor. <br>
                        
                          int a;
                          int b;
                        };
                    </p>

            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>4. Polymorphism – Stems from Inheritance. A subclass can define its own unique behavior and still share the same functionalities or behavior of its parent/base class. A subclass can have their own behavior and share some of its behavior from its parent class not the other way around. A parent class cannot have the behavior of its subclass</p>
            <ul class="card">
                <li>Method Overriding -a language feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes.</li>
                <img src="./assets/images/Method_Overriding.jpg" alt="class vehicle model u-shape line connecting class car box">
                <li>Method Overloading -  is a form of polymorphism in OOP. Polymorphism allows objects or methods to act in different ways, according to the means in which they are used. </li>
                <li>Runtime vs Compile-time - Compile time is the period when the programming code (such as C#, Java, C, Python) is converted to the machine code (i.e. binary code). Runtime is the period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.</li>
                <img src="./assets/images/compile time v run time.png"alt="Big circle object with a Smaller circle Paper class inside">
                <li>Covariance vs Contravariance -Frequently it seems like it would be nice if when a method is overridden we could change the argument types or return types. A change that moves down the inheritance hierarchy, making it more specific, is said to be covariant. A change that moves up the inheritance hierarchy is said to be contravariant.</li>
                    <p class="item">class Parent {
                        void test (covar : Mammal, contravar : Mammal) : boolean <br>
                    }
                    
                    class Child extends Parent {
                        void test (covar : Cat, contravar : Animal) : boolean <br>
                    } <br>

                    While appealing, this idea runs into trouble with the principle of substitution. <br>

                        Parent aValue = new  Child();
                        aValue.text(new Dog(), new Mammal()); // is this legal??</p>
                <li>Classes - What is a polymorphic class?
                    A class that declares or inherits a virtual function</li>
                <li>Properties - are as in everyday language and technically are fields of objects/classes with dedicated getter/setter routines (which can be considered as methods. There are languages that don't have properties and this behavior is achieved using a private field+get/set methods.) </li>
                    <p class="item">class Marker(): <br>

                        @property <br>
                        def marker_color(self): <br>
                            return self._marker_color <br>
                        <br>
                        @color.setter <br>
                        def color(self, color): <br>
                            self._marker_color = Blue <br>
                            self._marker_color = Red</p>
                <li>Parameters - a special kind of variable used in a function to refer to one of the pieces of data provided as input to the functio</li>
